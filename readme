Here’s a Pod created inside a host machine 
Volume is mapped with hostpath and is defined as hostpath
Hostpath’s data dir ie.  /tmp/data is mapped with the volume of Pod
So that whatever we will update in pod’s container that will be stored in /tmp/data
This data will be accessible from the container and also from the host machine viceversa
This data can be mapped to any other POD inside this host machine

How to run

kubectl apply -f hostpath.yml
kubectl get pods
Now execute pod in an interactive terminal and go inside  /tmp/hostpath, ie.
kubectl exec -it myvolhostpath -- /bin/bash
cd  /tmp/hostpath
Make a file1.txt  here 
Now, do
minikube ssh (on docker hub to go inside host machine) 
ls /tmp/data
You will see  file1.txt here
