Emptydir volume is accessible  inside a pod
If any container is deleted, now when new container is created, volume will definetely be shared by that new container
If in case Pod is deleted, volume will also be deleted. And when new Pod is recreated, a new volume will be recreated called "Emptydir"[An empty volume]
Its main purpose is to share volume b/w multiple containers but only within a same pod
volume is mounted to each container using variable "mountvolume", so each container will access same volume

-----
 Commands:
kubectl apply -f emptydir.yml
kubectl get pods
Execute  voltestpod  in an interactive terminal and go inside container1
kubectl exec voltestpod -c c01 -it -- /bin/bash
cd /tmp
ls
you'll see xchange dir here
cd xchange
Make a file here (file1.txt)
Now go inside container c02
cd /tmp cd data
you'll see file.txt here, Edit it and exit
Now go inside c01 & check updation done by you in file1 is reflecting there ( bcoz volume is shared among c01 & c02 )
